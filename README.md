## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (recommended for package management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-classification.git
   cd cancer-classification
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env_name
   source env_name/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env_name\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   Make sure to install the libraries needed for your project manually. You can typically do this using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install <opencv-python Pillow numpy pandas tensorflow >  # Replace <library_name> with the actual libraries you need
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The application processes data from medical images and other relevant sources to prepare for classification.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The model is built and trained using the notebook `model.ipynb`, which implements various machine learning techniques for effective cancer detection.

3. **Application Logic**:
   - `app.py` contains the main application logic, providing a graphical user interface for users to interact with the model.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users can upload medical images and receive predictions on the likelihood of cancer based on the trained model.
